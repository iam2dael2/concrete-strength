# Concrete Strength
## Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate the compressive strength of concrete using the Concrete Compressive Strength dataset available on Kaggle. The project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the strength of concrete based on its composition and curing conditions. The model can assist in optimizing concrete mixtures, predicting structural performance, and guiding construction decisions.

## Dataset Description
The Concrete Compressive Strength dataset, available on Kaggle, provides information on the compressive strength of concrete samples. This dataset is widely used in machine learning and data mining research for predicting the strength of concrete based on its composition and curing conditions.
### Dataset Details
* Number of Instances: 1,030
* Number of Attributes: 9
#### Attribute Information:
The Concrete Compressive Strength dataset includes the following attributes:
1. Cement (kg/m^3): The amount of cement used in the concrete mixture.
2. Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m^3): The amount of blast furnace slag used in the concrete mixture.
3. Fly Ash (kg/m^3): The amount of fly ash used in the concrete mixture.
4. Water (kg/m^3): The amount of water used in the concrete mixture.
5. Superplasticizer (kg/m^3): The amount of superplasticizer used in the concrete mixture.
6. Coarse Aggregate (kg/m^3): The amount of coarse aggregate (e.g., crushed stone) used in the concrete mixture.
7. Fine Aggregate (kg/m^3): The amount of fine aggregate (e.g., sand) used in the concrete mixture.
8. Age (days): The age of the concrete in days when the compressive strength was measured.
9. Compressive Strength (MPa): The measured compressive strength of the concrete in megapascals (MPa).
### Dataset Source:
The Concrete Compressive Strength dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data was collected by researchers to study the relationship between the components of concrete and its compressive strength.
